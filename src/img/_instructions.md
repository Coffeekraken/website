# Images

This folder will store all the images used in the project.
Here's some rules to follow in order to all work the same way across projects.

1. Filename convention
	- All **lowercase**
	- **Dash** separated
	- No spaces
	- Use meaningful names
	- Think about SEO while naming
		- Make sure important images have a precise name
	- Samples:
		- jti-power-banner-bkg.jpg
		- jti-power-banner-product.png
		- jti-power-usb-key.jpg
2. Folder structure
	- No subfolders (unless necessary)
