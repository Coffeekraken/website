# Fonts

This folder will store all the fonts used in the project.
Here's some rules to follow in order to all work the same way across projects.

1. Use **[google fonts](https://fonts.google.com)** at first if possible!
2. Store each fonts in his own folder that follow this structure:
	- **```my-cool-font```**
	- |--- ```font.css``` : Font-face declaration
	- |--- ```my-cool-font.{ext}``` : Each font files with different extensions like .eot, .woff, .woff2, etc...
3. Store your webfonts in a place where you can share them easily in order to avoid to generate them again and again across projects.
